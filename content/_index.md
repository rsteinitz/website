          My work explores how ecological changes shape animal behavior, physiology, and overall health.  
          
          I am currently a Postdoctoral Scientist with the **Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund**, working on an NIH-funded study that examines how early life adversity shapes lifelong health, resilience, and aging in **mountain gorillas** in Rwanda.  
          
          For my PhD, I investigated how red-tailed monkeys balance predation risk (_“landscape of fear”_) and feeding competition (_“landscape of food”_), and how these pressures shape their energy allocation and reproduction. Before that, I studied shifts in **bobcat** prey preference during the California drought and niche partitioning in endangered **rock iguanas** in the Caribbean.  
          
          I am passionate about translating complex ecological and physiological data into actionable insights that support wildlife conservation. My work blends field research, quantitative analysis, and compelling science communication.  
          
          **Let’s connect to collaborate or share ideas about wildlife, ecology, and innovative research!**
