          My work explores how ecological changes shape animal behavior and physiology.
          
          I use data science to uncover complex interactions between wildlife and their environments. My dissertation examined how **red-tailed monkeys** (_Cercopithecus ascanius_) navigate intra-guild predation (_"landscape of fear"_) and habitat productivity and feeding competition (_"landscape of food"_), and the downstream tradeoffs in energy allocation and reproduction.
          
          Before my PhD, I uncovered shifts in prey preferences of **bobcats** during the California Drought and documented competitive niche partitioning in endangered **rock iguanas** in the Caribbean.
          
          I thrive on transforming data into actionable conservation insights. My mission is to bridge fieldwork, advanced analytics, and compelling science communication to drive biodiversity preservation.
          
          **Letâ€™s connect to collaborate or share ideas about  
          wildlife, ecology, and innovative research!**
