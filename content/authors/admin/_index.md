## About Me

I am a wildlife biologist and data scientist. My research explores feeding ecology and food-web dynamics using advanced analysis and modeling in R and GIS. I study primate physiology, energetics, and aging, bobcat foraging, and ecological niche partitioning in endangered species.

I welcome collaborations in conservation research and data science.
