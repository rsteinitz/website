## About Me

I am a wildlife biologist and data scientist. My research explores feeding ecology and food-web dynamics, using advanced analysis and modeling in R and GIS. I studied primate physiology, reproduction, and aging, bobcat foraging, and niche partitioning in endangered reptiles.

I am currently welcoming invitations for collaboration.
