## At a glance

- **What:** Linking early life experiences to adult health, stress physiology, and aging in mountain gorillas.
- **Why** These relationships shape survival, reproduction, and long-term population resilience.
- **How:** Developing and applying a panel of non-invasive biomarkers that track stress, immune function, and physiological wear-and-tear across the lifespan.

## My role

- Designed the **validation strategy** (parallelism, accuracy, precision, robustness).
- Built **R workflows** for plate data processing, QC, and statistical analysis.
- Coordinated **field–lab integration** across Rwanda and the U.S.
