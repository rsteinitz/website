abstract: >
  Estimates of food abundance are central in studies of primate behavior and are usually comprised of visual measurements from the ground, yielding crude estimates of food biomass. This method is time- and labor-intensive, especially in tropical rainforests where most primates live. Remote-sensed data is a powerful alternative for calculating vegetation indices (VIs). We tested two VIs derived from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer dataset as estimates of food availability and energy gain for fruit-eating monkeys in Western Uganda. We calculated NDVI and EVI for six groups of red-tailed monkeys (Cercopithecus ascanius) over four years. There was no relationship between the VIs and fruit production; additionally, fruit production did not correspond directly with monkey energy balance. Instead, the interaction between NDVI and fruit production predicted energy balance. These findings indicate that more research is needed to disentangle the relationships among plant reproduction, VIs, and consumer energetic condition.

summary: >
  Remote-sensed vegetation indices (VIs) interact with phenology to predict energy gain for red-tailed monkeys.
