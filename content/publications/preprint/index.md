abstract: >
  Interspecific competition for food is a key constraint on reproduction, social interactions, and community structure, though it is understudied in primatology. We investigate how larger-bodied competitors, especially chimpanzees, affect the energy gain of red-tailed monkeys (*Cercopithecus ascanius*) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We measured energy balance (E<sub>B</sub>) via urinary C-peptide levels, a non-invasive biomarker of energy intake. Ripe fruit abundance alone did not predict E<sub>B</sub>, but chimpanzee presence moderated the effect of food availability. Red-tail E<sub>B</sub> declined with more ripe fruits when chimpanzees were present but improved when competition was weaker. Associations with mangabeys negatively affected E<sub>B</sub>, while blue monkeys had no impact. Higher foraging efforts correlated with increased E<sub>B</sub>, but chimpanzees disrupted this relationship, reducing foraging efficiency. These findings highlight the critical role of interspecific competition in shaping energy dynamics, emphasizing its importance in predictive models of primate behavior.

summary: >
  Competition and intra-guild predation reduce red-tailed monkeys’ energy gain, emphasizing their importance in primate ecology.
