abstract: Interspecific competition for food is a key constraint on reproduction, social interactions, and community structure, though it is understudied in primatology. We investigate how larger-bodied competitors, especially chimpanzees, affect the energy gain of red-tailed monkeys (*Cercopithecus ascanius*) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We measured energy balance (E<sub>B</sub>) via urinary C-peptide levels, a non-invasive biomarker of energy intake. Ripe fruit abundance alone did not predict E<sub>B</sub>, but chimpanzee presence moderated the effect of food availability. Red-tail E<sub>B</sub> declined with more ripe fruits when chimpanzees were present but improved when competition was weaker. Associations with mangabeys negatively affected E<sub>B</sub>, while blue monkeys had no impact. Higher foraging efforts correlated with increased E<sub>B</sub>, but chimpanzees disrupted this relationship, reducing foraging efficiency. These findings highlight the critical role of interspecific competition in shaping energy dynamics, emphasizing its importance in predictive models of primate behavior.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Competition and intra-guild predation disrupt red-tailed monkeysâ€™ energy gain, emphasizing their importance in studies of primate ecology.
